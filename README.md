## `survivalists`

A data frame of survivalists across all 9 seasons detailing name and
demographics, location and profession, result, days lasted, reasons for
tapping out (detailed and categorised), page URL.

Dataset features:

  preppred or other versions)

- `name`: Name of the survivalist
- `age`: Age of survivalist
- `gender`: Gender
- `city`: City
- `state`: State
- `country`: Country
- `result`: Place the survivalist finished in the season
- `days_lasted`: The number of days lasted in the game before tapping
  out or winning
- `medically_evacuated`: Logical. If the survivalist was medically
  evacuated from the game
- `reason_tapped_out`: The reason the survivalist tapped out of the
  game. `NA` means they were the winner
- `reason_category`: A simplified category of the reason for tapping out
- `team`: The team they were associated with (only for season 4)
- `day_linked_up`: Day the team members linked up
- `profession`: Profession

  with <https://www.history.com/shows/alone/cast>
- `image_url`: URL of survivalist image from the history channel. Prefix
  URL with
  <https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/cdn.watch.aetnd.com/sites/2/>

``` r
library(tidyverse)

df <- expand_grid(
  days_lasted = 0:max(survivalists$days_lasted),
  gender = unique(survivalists$gender)
) |> 
  left_join(
    survivalists |> 
      count(days_lasted, gender),
    by = c("days_lasted", "gender")
  ) |> 
  left_join(
    survivalists |> 
      count(gender, name = "N"),
    by = "gender"
  ) |> 
  group_by(gender) |> 
  mutate(
    n = replace_na(n, 0),
    n_lasted = N-cumsum(n),
    p = n_lasted/N
  ) 

# Kaplan-Meier survival curves
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(days_lasted, p, colour = gender)) +
  geom_line() 

# boxplots
survivalists |> 
  ggplot(aes(days_lasted, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, pch = 1, size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

  ggplot(aes(item, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(item, n + 3, label = n), family = ft, size = 12, colour = txt) +
