# Datasets

## `survivalists`

A data frame of survivalists across all 9 seasons detailing name and demographics, location and profession, result, days lasted, reasons for tapping out (detailed and categorised), page URL.

Dataset features:

* `version`: The version country code (currently only US but getting preppred or other versions)
* `season`: The season number
* `id`: Survivalist unique ID
* `name`: Name of the survivalist
* `first_name`: First name of the survivalist
* `last_name`: last name of the survivalist
* `age`: Age of survivalist
* `gender`: Gender
* `city`: City
* `state`: State
* `country`: Country
* `result`: Place the survivalist finished in the season
* `days_lasted`: The number of days lasted in the game before tapping out or winning
* `medically_evacuated`: Logical. If the survivalist was medically evacuated from the game
* `reason_tapped_out`: The reason the survivalist tapped out of the game. `NA` means they were the winner
* `reason_category`: A simplified category of the reason for tapping out
* `team`: The team they were associated with (only for season 4)
* `day_linked_up`: Day the team members linked up
* `profession`: Profession



```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- expand_grid(
  days_lasted = 0:max(survivalists$days_lasted),
  gender = unique(survivalists$gender)
) |> 
  left_join(
    survivalists |> 
      count(days_lasted, gender),
    by = c("days_lasted", "gender")
  ) |> 
  left_join(
    survivalists |> 
      count(gender, name = "N"),
    by = "gender"
  ) |> 
  group_by(gender) |> 
  mutate(
    n = replace_na(n, 0),
    n_lasted = N-cumsum(n),
    p = n_lasted/N
  ) 

# Kaplan-Meier survival curves
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(days_lasted, p, colour = gender)) +
  geom_line() 

# boxplots
survivalists |> 
  ggplot(aes(days_lasted, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, pch = 1, size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## `loadouts`
  
Each survivalist is allowed to take with them 10 items. This dataset includes information on each survivalist's loadout. It has detailed item descriptions and a simplified version for easier aggregation and analysis.

* `version`: Country code for the version of the show
* `season`: The season number
* `id`: Survivalist unique ID
* `name`: Name of the survivalist
* `item_number`: Item number
* `item_detailed`: Detailed loadout item description
* `item`: Loadout item. Simplified for aggregation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(forcats)

loadouts |>
  count(item) |>
  mutate(item = fct_reorder(item, n, max)) |>
  ggplot(aes(item, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(item, n + 3, label = n), family = ft, size = 12, colour = txt) +
  coord_flip()
```
